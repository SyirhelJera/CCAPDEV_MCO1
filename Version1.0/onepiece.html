<p>i haven't watched this film but i got many spoilers from YouTube & insta & quora so i know that this film is good but still Shanks didn't fought that much, he fought Kizaru & defeated him but his advance conquerors haki wasn't much of a problem for the admirals so now we know that his advance conquerors haki is something great but not enough to defeat an admiral & the animation was fire i mean real good, Luffy's Gear 5 was shown too & Shanks & Luffy fought together against some villian or whatever idk exactly.

    After seeing some reviews of other people i guess this film is a 7/10 which is actually good.</p>

        <p>This movie was not good they had nerfed luffy. Trust me I am an one piece fan luffy can use conqueror haki like shanks and he is on another level but in this movie luffy was not fighting upto the level as his crew. Just to promote uta they had nerfed luffy.  Dont compare this movie with one piece stampede, it was way better than this movie. you can watch this movie for shanks coc power level and for being an one piece fan.</p>

        <p>At first I was like: "wow the animation is really cool"
            And then in the middle I was like: "this isn't going anywhere and the story is all over..."
            When the plot starting to untwist and the final battle begins: "........(tears started flowing non stop)"
            Everything is beautifully shot, the cinematography is the best I've seen, it must be a pleasure to work with Nolan, I hear he's a nice guy. My small claim to fame is when I saw him at an airport once and I rolled an orange gently towards his feet, he gave me a nevous smile then walked off. What a guy! 
            Amazing film, if you like 2001 a space Odyssey and The Karate kid you will love this. 
            5 stars.</p>

        <p>Hand down the best movie of all time. 
            This is undoubtedly one of the best films ever made yes EVER
            This isn't just a movie. It's an emotion. 
            Hans Zimmer music created a huge impact in this movie . I regret not watching this masterpiece in imax. For me the best thing was this didn’t come across as your normal Hollywood film with cliches and predictability this was refreshing and hopefully will inspire a whole new generation of people to study astronomy . The director used the concept of Predestination Paradox where the protagonist travels back in time in order to prevent some events. Though many movies used the similar concept but Nolan's way of using the concept is top-notch and it gives you goose flesh. 
            "Love is the only thing which transcends space and time"  I guess no other Sci fi movies has ever emphasized the concept of love and used it as a platform to create a bridge between daughter in earth and father who is light years away from earth. This is really unimaginable and way ahead of time. You can notice many nuances in this movie such as ^^in the Miller planet you can hear the ticking sound which is heard almost after every 1.25 seconds means 1 year passed on Earth.  ^^Throughout the movie nothing could contradict the proven laws of physics. ^^For a cornfield scene, Nolan sought to grow 500 acres of corn. The corn was then sold and he actually made a profit. if this isnt the proof of nolan's sheer brilliance then what it is ?
            Overall this is definitely a masterpiece and way ahead of time.
            i am so grateful for this movie and thank you nolan for giving us such a gem of a movie. 
            i would like to point out that during 1950's when the movie 7 samurai came out, it didnt go well but after few decades many directors uses that movie as a template for film making and the works of the legendary director kurosawa is celebrated now. Hence this movie will be recognised and celebrated after few decades. 
            IN NOLAN WE TRUST <3</p>
