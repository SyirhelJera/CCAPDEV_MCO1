<p>Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) are hitmen with a penchant for philosophical discussions. In this ultra-hip, multi-strand crime movie, their storyline is interwoven with those of their boss, gangster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) ; his actress wife, Mia (Uma Thurman) ; struggling boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) ; master fixer Winston Wolfe (Harvey Keitel) and a nervous pair of armed robbers, "Pumpkin" (Tim Roth) and "Honey Bunny" (Amanda Plummer).</p></div>

<p>Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece, a real titan, a classic, it really is a unique film and it has that classic Quentin Tarantino theme. The movie was great when it came out in the 90's and even now it's amazing, the movie has some of the best lines I've heard in a movie, so real, simple, unique ... it's what you expect it to be. hear in real life. The story is divided into three parts, it jumps from one story to another, they are not exactly in chronological order, but they manage to make a connection between the characters, you can connect with the characters very easily. The cast was incredible John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Amanda Plummer, Maria de Medeiros, Ving Rhames, Rosanna Arquette, Eric Stoltz, Christopher Walken, Quentin Tarantino, a bestial cast, some gorgeous actors, each of them had stunning lines and amazing performance The film is good, it makes me want more, Tarantino knows how to make a film and I will say that he is one of the best film directors. The movie kept me captivated until the end, I laughed, I was shocked and I had a great time. However, they are very curious what is in the briefcase, some say that there were dynamite, others with religion, gold or others.  </div>

    <p>This is truly a superb masterpiece that will be remembered for years, to decades to centuries! Quentin Tarantino really lets his imagination go wild for this heck of a ride, including the viewer too for everyone's wondering what was in that case. The soundtrack is one of my all time favorites and the layering of the story and the chapters are really remarkable. The plot not only lets the watcher see the whole film in its normal order, but from the characters perspective and view of it too. The tone of the film never gets slow and never goes over the line, but with of course Tarantino, the line is invisible which gives this film as I like to call it, a 'personality'. The story line is so raw and original it really is nail biting to see what's gonna happen next if it is or will be your first time seeing it.</p>

        <p>The most important film of the 1990s. I say that because of the impact it had at the time and the endless volume of clones it generated and the lasting legacy it's had. People were quite literally saying "you can do that in a movie?!". Quentin basically birthed an entirely new sub-genre of film. He popularized the non-linear story telling style that is so common nowadays and really was the one who started the trend of characters talking about everyday nonsense things not related to the plot etc. 

            The film focuses on the intertwining timelines/stories of several characters: two hitmen, a boxer, a mob boss and his wife and two lovers holding up a diner. In a truly genius way, all these stories perfectly weave together in non-linear fashion. Tarantino stuffs the film with endless pop culture references, surf music and graphic violence that is paired with some of the best dialogue committed to screen. They're a truly likeable bunch despite being murderers, drug dealers and generally bad guys by trade. 
            
            It can not really be understated how this film impacted the world of film making and audiences at the time. It is a definitive masterpiece of the 1990s and will likely be appreciated for many years to come for how ground breaking it was. It also basically cemented Tarantino as one of the greats.</p>

        <p>This film has everything. Pulp Fiction delivers an array of aesthetically pleasing shots and beautiful cinematography, incredibly thought provoking lines and just the right amount of violence. As expected, Tarantino never fails to impress. This remains one of my all time favourites. 

            Admittedly, aside from Reservoir Dogs, I've always considered Tarantino's work to be a little less than what it's hyped up to be. Pulp Fiction, however, deserves all of that hype and more. 
            
            In attempt to refrain from analyzing this movie too deeply, I'll just say that watching it for the first time is an experience unlike any other. It's one of the only films I've seen that I've had to rewatch immediately after finishing. WATCH IT !!! It remains a cinematic masterpiece that's relevance never falters.<3</p>
