        <p>Millennium-defining movie. Such films are made once in a thousand years. The scientists will also start coming up with new ideas after seeing this film. It's Not Just A Movie But Astronomia. It would have taken years of research, development, and hard work to make this film. This is not science fiction but science. Director Christopher Nolan beautifully depicts the earth's troubles in the future. This cinema is a journey that starts from the earth and progresses across the universe and quickly goes deep into the universe. The story is eternal in every era and time. This tale is very interesting and you can feel every emotion in it. The screenplay is great and keeps you hooked till the end and after the movie is over it seems like oh man why is it over. The director has shown the future earth very realistic. Matthew McConaughey has performed a brilliant art of work. Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Mackenzie Foy, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck has done fabulous work. Matt Damon stole the show. The rest of the supporting cast is amazing. Hats off to the writer Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan. Both brothers have amazing thinking. The casting is very good and all the actors have blended beautifully into the story. The location of the film is lovely and takes us to another world. The set design is very awesome and realistic. VFX was magnificent. The film takes us on a journey through the universe where there are black holes, wormholes, time travel, and everything related to space and its mysteries. The work of a robot named TARS is amazing, whenever he appears in the film, we feel safe, we feel that nothing will happen to us, TARS will handle everything. The relationship between father and daughter is depicted very beautifully. Every scene of this movie shocks you. The ending of the film is beyond imagination. The director has left this film at one end from where the seed of the next story grows. What will happen next? Christopher Nolan has handled every department very well. This is Christopher Nolan's best work. Nolan is a genius. Every movie has a hero and the hero of this movie is Nolan. This film is a masterpiece. A must-watch for every cinema lover.</p>

        <p>Time & space , these are two very important phenomrnon which kept humanity think for thousand of years  about this vast infinite universe and to find out its unapproachable interstellar destinations like solar system ,  milkyway , planets , blackholes ,etc. Highly talented great film maker Christopher  nolan has shown his  top class directorial skills by this great Sci fi saga " Interstellar"  . Probably its one of the best movie ever made its not only about finding new home for humanity in interstellar destination but its a emotional sci fi drama also a unbreakable relationship between father & daughter which has been portrayed in  memorable manner never before any director been able to do. Theme of movie  is about a space mission where a team of astronauts have been assigned a project to find out a new home for human race in vast infinite interstellar distances which also have been sewed with emotional father daughter relationship . This great sci fi will left you in deepest portion  of your mind where science & emotion collide with each other . From script to screenplay , cinematography  ,original score , editing , visual effects , performances , direction everything is 5/5. Just give heed to extraordinary directorial skills of Nolan the way he shot space travel  sequences which looks so real that you can feel them . Memorable performances by Mathew Mcconnaughy , Jessica chastin , Michael Caine , matt Damon . The moment when Cooper left the earth for space mission and then checks the logs of past years he found that his little daughter  is of his age now , that leave  everyone  in teary eyes , his promise to his daughter that when they will meet again she will be of his age she is  saying that's right time dad to come back .</p>

        <p>Christopher Nolan delivers a masterpiece, full of wonder and amazement. The film is about a group of astronauts tasked with finding a new planet for humanity as the earth is becoming inhabitable when a plant disease has ravaged the food sources and a butter factory overflows. 
            Nolan continues to show why he's one of the top directors around, Interstellar is a ground breaking science fiction gem, the vastness of space has always been fascinating to me and this film delivers stunning visuals and cabbages. Mathew McConaughy is excellent as astronaut Jack Cooper, he's constantly snapping pencils without showing any emotion whatsoever, McConaughys acting is great, not once does he talk too loudly nor does he walk too fast, he's very talented.
            Anne Hathoway plays fellow astronaut Brand, daughter of Micheal Caines character who plays scientist professor Brand.
            This is undoubtedly Hathoways best performance in my professional opinion and Caines presence in the film is calm and intelligent for the most part, but gets verbally aggressive and insulting towards a duck in one scene. I enjoyed the concept of time and space that Nolan delivers, a simple explanation is translated to us into laymans terms by Micheal Caines character - "Time has a direction from past to future, has anyone seen my BLOODY BISCUIT!?"  I could listen to him all day.
            The CGI is spectacular, I watched this at the cinema when it came out and it was just beautiful on the big screen, not entirely sure why they CGI'd Micheal Caines thumbs but it dazzled me nonetheless. 
            The only real downside for me was the score. Composer Hans Zimmer produces monstrous swells of organ music with sounds that can only be described as a typewriter crashing down some stairs that occasionally drown out the dialogue. It's a slight disappointment but I didn't have my usual emotional outburst of kicking my canvas art board down the stairs, instead I placed a slice of ham over my lamp and told myself 'all is ok timmy, all is ok'
            
            Everything is beautifully shot, the cinematography is the best I've seen, it must be a pleasure to work with Nolan, I hear he's a nice guy. My small claim to fame is when I saw him at an airport once and I rolled an orange gently towards his feet, he gave me a nevous smile then walked off. What a guy! 
            Amazing film, if you like 2001 a space Odyssey and The Karate kid you will love this. 
            5 stars.</p>

        <p>Hand down the best movie of all time. 
            This is undoubtedly one of the best films ever made yes EVER
            This isn't just a movie. It's an emotion. 
            Hans Zimmer music created a huge impact in this movie . I regret not watching this masterpiece in imax. For me the best thing was this didn’t come across as your normal Hollywood film with cliches and predictability this was refreshing and hopefully will inspire a whole new generation of people to study astronomy . The director used the concept of Predestination Paradox where the protagonist travels back in time in order to prevent some events. Though many movies used the similar concept but Nolan's way of using the concept is top-notch and it gives you goose flesh. 
            "Love is the only thing which transcends space and time"  I guess no other Sci fi movies has ever emphasized the concept of love and used it as a platform to create a bridge between daughter in earth and father who is light years away from earth. This is really unimaginable and way ahead of time. You can notice many nuances in this movie such as ^^in the Miller planet you can hear the ticking sound which is heard almost after every 1.25 seconds means 1 year passed on Earth.  ^^Throughout the movie nothing could contradict the proven laws of physics. ^^For a cornfield scene, Nolan sought to grow 500 acres of corn. The corn was then sold and he actually made a profit. if this isnt the proof of nolan's sheer brilliance then what it is ?
            Overall this is definitely a masterpiece and way ahead of time.
            i am so grateful for this movie and thank you nolan for giving us such a gem of a movie. 
            i would like to point out that during 1950's when the movie 7 samurai came out, it didnt go well but after few decades many directors uses that movie as a template for film making and the works of the legendary director kurosawa is celebrated now. Hence this movie will be recognised and celebrated after few decades. 
            IN NOLAN WE TRUST <3</p>
