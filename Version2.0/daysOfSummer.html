<p>This film hits especially close to home for anyone who has ever punched above their weight or wrongly idolised someone they were physically attracted to.

    I believe that the protagonist's experience is no better summed up than in the 'expectations vs reality' scene. This scene is one of the most masterfully written, acted and directed scenes I have ever seen. It hits so close to home with so many viewers.
    
    Above all else, this movie eloquently takes us on the journey of 'boy meets girl' without the happy ending of 'boy marries girl.' And (*SPOILER*) while the ending of 'boy meets even hotter girl and presumably lives happily ever after with her' is a little farfetched, it does accurately reflect the fact that most people in the protagonist's position do move on eventually and find someone new - someone more appropriate and 'real'.
    
    "I think technically the girl of my dreams would probably have a really bodacious rack, maybe different hair and she'd probably be more into sports. But truthfully, Robin's better than the girl of my dreams. She's Real."</p>

    <p>This movie is especially for those of us who have both destroyed, and been destroyed; who had all hope, only to lose it unexpectedly, just like that. This movie is especially, for those of us who didn't believe we'd ever find hope again, but somehow happened upon some, seemingly by chance. However, years after the fact you'll come to realize that every hardship had a more glorious purpose than you could have possibly envisioned with your limited perspective for the time, even though it happened right before your eyes. After which you'll shake your head, laugh in disbelief, as you finally see the bigger picture. 
        If this sounds like you, then like me, you'll get the feeling that someone observed you from afar, never told you what they were doing, only to release the best movie your soul could've asked for.
        If you want to find a new favorite movie to keep around year after year as though you were aging a bottle of the finest wine, then I highly recommend you make room in your movie cellar, for: "500 Days of Summer". This review will make more sense after you watch it... so stop mindlessly browsing... because you don't actually feel like watching a movie and are simply wasting your time doing anything you can to forget about the troubles of your current life. Just watch this, feel good again, and perhaps even, motivated, to enjoy those problems inevitably heading your way, because something good might be just around the corner. It might not. You'll never know until you click play.
        ...So enjoy ;). I know you will.</p>

        <p>Its Not The New Generation Annie Hall But i think it Was a Good Movie With Unique & Strong Vision it Can Helps Many Guys & Girls After Their Broke up.
            But Sure This Movie Came Short in Making Deeply Side Characters....
            i Mean I Couldnt Communicate With Anyone In Toms Friends..
            in Personal I Care About The Music in This Genre of Movie But in This Catagory I Think This Movie Could Be Better....
            Dont Get Me Wrong Feelings Everything Were There But it Wasnt So Spectacular Like The Iconic Movies In This Genre Like Casabalanca and Even Average Good Movies Like About Time...
            Joseph Gordon Lewitt Take Care Of His Part in Good Way. He is Capable To Be a Guy That isnt Too much Geek Too Much Handsome Too Much Weird And......
            He is Just a Normal Person like Many Guys...
            i Really Liked The Vision of The Story It Was Optimist & Real in The Same Time....
            It Shows Us That Many Girls That We Think "She is The One" So Big News: They Are Not!
            They are Just  Highways In Our Many Highways in Our Life Until We Get The Real "One".
            500 Days of Summer is Not a Poet,It is Like A Wise Man That Wants To Show You How the Relationships Work In Our Age.
            Hope You Enjoy....

        <p>Story: 4/5. It's charming and funny, as anything with Zooey often is. The film outlines what it's about early on, making it clear that it really is about the experience more than it is about the journey. It's not a ground-breaking journey by any stretch, but it is a fun and sometimes tumultuous one. The cast was all-round pretty good.

            Visuals: 3/5. The cinematography as a whole isn't anything more than standard, but there are sequences here and there that explored some interesting ideas and framing. The rooftop party scene, to be specific.
            
            Sound: 4/5. The soundtrack is spectacular. The person behind the music choices did a great job and had (at least, in my eyes) really good taste. The use of the music was appropriate without ever being awkwardly brief or overstaying its welcome.
            
            11/15: A good time with a couple of laughs and a touch of introspection.<3</p>
