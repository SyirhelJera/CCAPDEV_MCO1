<p>An Artistic Visual brilliance.
    Came through a post on FB some hours ago about this anime film named “ Your Name”. That post had some relatable lines which triggered my soul right through so i downloaded this film right away and just finished watching it, the laptop is in my hands while the credits are getting rolled down and i am all emotional coming straight here to right my emotions about this art. Am literally out of the words to explain the emotional feeling am having right now, dont know where to start, the story, the connection of the souls who never really met, the cinematography, the direction or the story telling or the relatable dialogoes. Everything is all mixed up, i hardly turn up to animated movies apart from some childhood nostalgic ones. This movie took my heart straight away, the last time something from cinema made me like this, it was probably the ending scene from the Dark series or the release of ZSLJ. The rom com genre is not my go through but this animated film has taken my heart, lost in words not able to explain anything further. This movie straight away goes into the elite list of my favourites and probably in top 5 right there with “Requiem for a dream”, “Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind”, the movies that still has my heart to date. I literally jumped out in excitement in the last scene where I kept hoping taki and mitsuha could greet each other and when taki called her from behind, I had a moment like Will Smith who claps emotionally when he finally gets his job as a broker at the end of Pursuit of Happyness.
    In a way the thing that connected me with this was the thorough relevance it had with me in some way, there are days when you wake up lost and u have a feeling of searching someone very dear who is lost but never really know who it is and why are u even trying to find them out, the one u never really have met but is still very known to you. The feeling if it is a dream world or a reality, where are u living and what is the difference between them?  </div>

    <p>The storytelling within "Your Name." , after taking a step back, opened my eyes to the magnificent elegance it portrayed to viewers like me. To know that stories like these exist really astound me to this day and helped to spark my interest in writing once more. Heck, it even urged me to write a review for it, despite me almost never writing reviews for shows or movies, even if they were my favorites/ones I loved.

        While the plot had its ups and downs (just little nitpicks and MAINLY UPS) here and there, the music, animation, and the mere execution of the movie, in my opinion, makes up for it in its entirety. 
        
        Despite its supernatural elements, "Your Name." exhibited a large amount of humanity and the interactions and thoughts between characters felt real, given the sentiment and each individual's longing, relishing us with a sense of genuineness and realism amidst the otherworldly plot.
        
        The animation is the best I've seen as of my rookie career as an anime enjoyer so I don't really have much expertise to say here but I can assure that the graphics goes above and beyond than even what some Japanese animation films provide today.
        
        The music also tugged SEVERAL chords in my heart and to be frank, the ending always gets me because of it's music choice and orchestration. Yet, they are many more songs of significance like "Zenzenzense" or "Sparkle" to be mentioned. Though, you should hear them yourself if you ever watch the movie.
        
        It's been literally 2 days since I watched the movie and I already re-watched it with a close friend today and I plan to re-watch it even more in the future as more people who are unfamiliar with the movie comes along.
        
        I urge that everyone should at least watch this movie once, both for the story and the mere experience of watching of what I think of, is a masterpiece in today's world of film animation.</p>

        <p>4 years on, and this movie is still wedged in my heart. 
            I see reviews here trying to describe this movie. A romcom about two teenagers and an interesting ability to swap bodies at any time within a week. They both grow to love each other as they live in the other's lives. However, there is nothing I could do to replicate or try to explain what I really experienced out of the 6 times I've watched this film. The artwork is without a doubt stunning, the prettiest animation I've seen across any medium. The music is heartfelt, melancholic, inscribed into my heart and brain. I could skip to any part of the movie and hum the OST accurately. Not to mention the 4 incredibly moving and addictive songs - Yumetouru, Zen Zen Zense, Sparkle and Nandemonaiya. Each of these 4 have their own unique sound, with beautifully written lyrics that paint a fantastical picture in my mind every time I listen to them. 
            The movie's theme of destiny, fate, and longing for someone may not be new, but it was executed perfectly. Its atmosphere and mood placed me in a space where I didn't know existed. Everything felt so dreamy, out of this world, so astronomical, yet, so attainable. 
            
            But, like I said. I could never replicate and regurgitate my feelings, my experience, when I watched Taki and Mitsuha struggling beautifully in this film. So, go and watch it.
            
            10/10, my all-time favourite movie.</p>

        <p>experience with only a few other movies.

            Not only is it a heartwarming romance but a intriguing mystery mixed with the beautiful Japanese traditions showing us just how amazing their culture is.
            
            The animation quality is one of if not the best seen so far and deserves every bit of praise it gets, especially those scenic views and may I add that they are all hand drawn, but what pushes it above and beyond compared to other animated movies is the soundtrack, like OMG this not only changes with the mood of the scene but can convey the mood by it self and that's not giving credit to the wonderful vocals and extraordinary instrumentals.
            
            But if I were to rate this it would be a 10/10 and a must watch for anyone looking to have a heartwarming experience to all ages even those who are sceptical about or think anime is for nerds it not only shows that love is difficult to find, but that when you find the one you've been looking for the trials and hardships of your journey to reach the point your at are feel insignificant compared to how you feel when you finally find your love.<3</p>
